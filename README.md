# Solar System

## Description
This project will take all the planets in the solar system and display their names in cards. When a user hovers a name of a planet the name should disappear and an image of the planet should appear. When the user clicks on the planet all the other planet cards should go away and the only thing that should remain is an image of that planet and a description about that planet. When the user clicks on the red X on a single planet that information goes away and all the original cards are displayed again. When the user types in the search bar, planet cards should only show up if they have what is typed in their name or description.
